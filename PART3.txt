Part 3: Code Review Questions
Please answer the following questions in a text file:

State Management:
Why did you choose the specific state management approach? How
would you scale it for a larger application?
-I chose redux toolkit for state management. Honestly this is probably the 2nd time I have 
used this as this really isn't what I normally use but upon further research it does simplify
the process of managing state and includes best practices for structuring Redux logic. Previously I have
used the basic hooks such as useState or useContext.

Performance Optimization:
What techniques did you use to optimize the performance of the
application? How do they work?
-One is efficient use of state with the use of redux toolkit for state management. Also while not fully implemented,
code splitting is one of the best ways to implement to optimize the performance. Another thing when implementing API integrations, lazy
loading would also be efficient to optimize performance.


Testing Strategy:
How do you decide which parts of the application need to be unit
tested? What are your guidelines?
Not tested lacked of time honeslty so I do have to apologize for it but initially the plan would be to analize which part of the code directly impacts the core functionality
of the app such ass state management actions, reducers, utility functions should be unit tested.


Code Structure:
Explain how you organized your project structure and why.
-The project is organized in a modular, feature-driven way to ensure maintainability and scalability.
This modular structure allows for better code readability, maintainability, and scalability as the app grows. Each feature is sectioned 
in their own folder making it easier to locate code needed.
